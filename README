Argent:  A dependently-typed higher-order stateful concurrent language.


This repository is for the core syntax and type checking of the Argent
programming language.  Argent is a language designed for building
highly robust, verified system.  A brief overview of the features of
the language follows:

 * Full higher-order dependent types, including types for representing
   the behavior of computations in a concurrent setting.

 * A realistic model of concurrency, making no assumptions beyond
   atomic read/write operations.

 * Higher-order polymorphism, eventually to support subtyping.

 * Built-in higher-order predicate logic for defining specifications.

 * Two-stage type checking, with a (decidable) first stage which
   produces verification conditions for the (undecidable) second
   stage for pay-as-you-go verification.

 * Designed to facilitate a wide range of uses.

 * Ability to enable or disable components of the type system to
   facilitate building different "layers" of a system.


Concept-

Argent is split into a surface syntax, which focuses on usability,
design, and software engineering concerns, and a core language, which
focuses on semantics, type checking, soundness proofs, and
compilation.  The surface syntax is translated into core, then type
checked, (optionally) verified, and ultimately compiled.  The language
is designed this way to get around a frequent problem where the syntax
of a language is easy to understand and use, but difficult to reason
about (ie Java), or else easy to reason about but difficult and
awkward to use (ie Haskell).

The type system and language is designed such that certain features
can be enabled or disabled for different compilation modes, allowing
different "layers" of a system to be built using the same language.

Argent core is based on a process algebra which represents concurrent
computations as generators of sequences of state transitions, with
state transitions themselves represented as the function space of the
domain of an algebra of nondeterministic (single-threaded)
computation, and with individual values represented by a traditional
domain of primitives, algebraic data types, and functions on them.
Types are represented as computable sets of computations, values,
lower-rank types, or propositions.  Propositions are an alternate
semantic domain that models intuitionistic logic.

For normal execution, we allow computations to operate on and produce
only values; computing on types or propositions is prohibited.
However, nothing in the language itself expressly prohibits this;
rather it an additional rule enforced by the type checker.
Computations which produce types can be allowed as a kind of
preprocessor, where computation on propositions provides an effective
way of implementing a theorem prover for Argent in Argent itself.

Type checking is designed to split into two distinct phases.  The
first phase is a decidable (or mostly decidable) phase, which makes
guarantees roughly equivalent to those made by Haskell or Standard
ML's type systems.  The first phase also produces a set of
verification conditions, which must be proven to ensure full
correctness.  The second phase consists of an undecidable procedure
for discharging the verification conditions.  Generally, the compiler
will not require the second phase to complete before compiling a
program.  This is designed to allow a number of different strategies
for the verification phase ranging over varying levels of soundness,
including 1) automated theorem proving, 2) interactive (manual)
theorem proving, 3) embedding proofs in the code, 4) using the
verification conditions as inputs to a model checking framework, 5)
deriving debugging or testing information, 6) inserting runtime
assertions, or 7) ignoring them completely.


Status-

Argent represents the implementation side of my (Eric McCorkle's) Ph.D
dissertation.  As such, there are distinct phases of work planned.

At present, I am converting and exporting an older (and much messier)
repository into this one.

One hurdle is the fact that the type checker needs a multivariate
polynomial normalization and math library to function properly.  I
have an old (ugly, inefficient) implementation, but this really ought
to be done the Right Way (tm), which probably involves calling out to
FFI.


Name-

Argent is a somewhat archaic term for silver, which is loosely derived
from System Implementation Language and VERification.  The word name
"argent" is chosen over the more common "silver" for reasons similar
to the choice of "java" over the more common "coffee", most notably a
higher probability of easily being found in a search engine.

The proper abbreviation is the chemical symbol for silver, ag (itself
derived from argentum, the latin root).
